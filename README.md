# Non-Linearity in Experiments



This repository contains the scripts for our preprint:

Whoever has will be given more? How to use the intercept-slope correlation in improving our understanding of replicability, heterogeneity, and theory development. (https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/s82zr)

All of the data is taken from the DRIPHT-Repository, that is a collection of direct-replication multi-lab projects: https://osf.io/g2fzq/.
